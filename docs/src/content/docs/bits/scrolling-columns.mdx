Four columns of images scrolling with different speeds in a panning 3D scene.

<BitPlayground client:only="react" bitName="ScrollingColumns" />

## Overview

This example demonstrates how to combine `Particles`, `Spawner`, and `Scene3D` to create a complex scrolling visual.

-   **Particles & Spawners**: Four separate spawners are used to create the columns. Each spawner has a different position and initial velocity, creating the "parallax" scrolling speed effect.
-   **Scene3D**: Creates the 3D environment.
-   **Camera Pan**: The camera gently pans horizontally by transitioning between two `Step` components over the entire duration of the video.

## Usage

This pattern is great for credits sequences, showcase galleries, or background visuals where you want to display a lot of content drifting by.
