Camera flies over an app screenshot while an animated cursor highlights different areas. Combines `Scene3D` camera movement with `StepResponsive` positioning.

<BitPlayground client:only="react" bitName="CursorFlyover" />

## Overview

This example demonstrates how to combine `Scene3D` steps for camera movement with `StepResponsive` for independently animating an overlay element (the cursor). The camera flies to different regions of a screenshot while the cursor smoothly repositions itself at each step.

Key techniques:
- **Element3D** places the screenshot in 3D space
- **Step** defines camera targets at different regions of the image
- **StepResponsive** independently animates the cursor position, scale, and opacity per step
