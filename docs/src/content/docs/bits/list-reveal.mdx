import { BitPlayground } from '@components/BitPlayground';

A common UI pattern showing a list of items appearing one after another. This uses `delay` and `stagger` to create a smooth, cascading entrance effect.

Uses two nested `StaggeredMotion` components: the outer one controls the vertical movement of each item, while the inner one applies a scaling effect for a more dynamic reveal.
