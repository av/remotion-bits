Multiple terminal windows positioned in a 3D scene with a typewriter effect simulating command execution. The camera transitions between terminals to create a dynamic narrative flow.

<BitPlayground client:only="react" bitName="Terminal3D" />

## Overview

This Bit demonstrates how to combine 3D positioning with 2D UI elements to create compelling narrative scenes. It uses:

- **Scene3D**: To position terminal windows in 3D space and manage camera transitions.
- **TypeWriter**: To simulate command execution and log output.
- Responsive Sizing: Using `useViewportRect` to ensure terminals scale correctly on different screen sizes.

## Usage

You can use the `Scene3D` component to create sequences of actions, moving the camera from one terminal to another to highlight different parts of a system or workflow.
