3D camera transitions between positioned steps, impress.js style.

<BitPlayground client:only="react" bitName="Elements3D" />

## Overview

The `Scene3D` component creates a 3D presentation environment where content is positioned in 3D space and a virtual camera smoothly transitions between steps. Inspired by [impress.js](https://impress.js.org/).
