Slow camera movement over images using Scene3D steps to create a Ken Burns effect.

<BitPlayground client:only="react" bitName="KenBurns" />

## Overview

The "Ken Burns" effect is achieved by defining `Scene3D` steps with different Z-depths and transition durations. The camera smoothly moves between these steps, creating a fly-through or zoom effect.

By animating the position properties (`x`, `y`, `z`) of each step, we can create complex camera movements over the images.
