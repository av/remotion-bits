# Installation

## Package Manager

Install Remotion Bits using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# npm
npm install remotion-bits

# pnpm
pnpm add remotion-bits

# yarn
yarn add remotion-bits
```

## Component Registry (jsrepo)

Copy individual components directly into your project:

```bash
npx jsrepo add text-transition
npx jsrepo add background-transition
npx jsrepo add motion-transition
```

This approach is useful if you want to:
- Customize component internals
- Reduce bundle size by only including what you need
- Have full control over the code

## Peer Dependencies

Remotion Bits requires:

- `remotion` >= 4.0.0
- `react` >= 18.0.0
- `react-dom` >= 18.0.0

These should already be installed if you have a Remotion project set up.

## Verifying Installation

Create a test composition to verify the installation:

```tsx
import { TextTransition } from 'remotion-bits';

export const TestComposition = () => {
  return (
    <TextTransition transition={{ opacity: [0, 1] }}>
      It works!
    </TextTransition>
  );
};
```
