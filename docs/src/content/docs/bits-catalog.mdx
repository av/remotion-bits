## How to Use Bits

Each bit in this catalog includes:
- **Live Preview**: Interactive player with playback controls to see the animation in action
- **Source Code**: View and optionally edit the implementation code
- **Metadata**: Duration, dimensions, and tags for easy reference

### Installation Methods

**Option 1: Install the full package**
```bash
npm install remotion-bits
```

Then import and use components directly:
```tsx
import { FadeIn } from 'remotion-bits';
```

**Option 2: Copy individual bits**

You can also copy the source code of any bit directly into your project if you prefer not to install the full package.

### Customization

All bits are fully customizable. You can:
- Adjust animation timing and duration
- Modify colors, gradients, and styles
- Change easing functions and transitions
- Combine multiple bits for complex effects

Copy the code from any playground and adapt it to your specific needs!
