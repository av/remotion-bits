description: The main container that manages the 3D viewport and camera transitions.
---

The `Scene3D` component creates a 3D presentation environment where content is positioned in 3D space and a virtual camera smoothly transitions between steps.

## Usage

```tsx
<Scene3D
  perspective={1000}          // CSS perspective (default: 1000)
  transitionDuration={30}     // Frames per camera transition
  easing="easeInOutCubic"     // Easing function for transitions
  stepDuration={60}           // Frames per step (auto-advance)
>
  {children}
</Scene3D>
```
