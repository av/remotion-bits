## Rect

The `Rect` class represents a rectangle and provides convenience getters for positioning.

```tsx
import { Rect } from "remotion-bits";

const rect = new Rect(1920, 1080);
```

### Properties
- `x`, `y`: Top-left coordinates.
- `width`, `height`: Dimensions.
- `left`, `top`, `right`, `bottom`: Edge coordinates.
- `cx`, `cy`: Center coordinates.
- `shorter`: The length of the shorter side.
- `longer`: The length of the longer side.

### Methods

#### `relative(x, y)`
Resolves relative coordinates (percentages or numbers) to absolute points within the rect.

```tsx
// 50% of width, 20% of height
const point = rect.relative("50%", "20%");
```
