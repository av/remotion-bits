# Remotion Bits

Remotion Bits provides animation components and complete example compositions (bits) for building Remotion videos. The workflow is: discover bits that match your needs, install them, customize, and compose into sequences.

## Installation

```bash
# Initialize jsrepo registry
npx jsrepo init https://unpkg.com/remotion-bits/registry.json

# Install components (reusable building blocks)
npx jsrepo add animated-text particle-system scene-3d

# Install bits (complete example compositions)
npx jsrepo add bit-3d-basic

# Or install from npm (library usage without customization)
npm install remotion-bits
```

Components install to `src/components/`, utilities to `src/utils/`, bits to `src/compositions/`.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Bits vs Components
- **Bits**: Complete, ready-to-use Remotion compositions demonstrating specific patterns (e.g., `bit-3d-basic`, `bit-particles-snow`)
- **Components**: Reusable building blocks used inside bits and custom compositions (e.g., `AnimatedText`, `Particles`, `Scene3D`)

Install bits as starting points for your video. Install components when building custom compositions.

### 2. AnimatedValue Pattern
Most components accept `AnimatedValue` for animated properties:
```tsx
opacity: 1              // Static value
opacity: [0, 1]         // Animate from 0 to 1
opacity: [0, 1, 0.5, 0] // Keyframes over duration
```

### 3. Responsive Sizing
Never hardcode pixel values. Use `useViewportRect()` for responsive scaling:
```tsx
const rect = useViewportRect(); // { width, height, vmin, vmax, vw, vh, cx, cy }
<div style={{ fontSize: rect.vmin * 5 }}>Scales with viewport</div>
```

### 4. Component Categories
- **Text**: `AnimatedText` - character/word/line animations with stagger
- **Motion**: `StaggeredMotion` - animate multiple elements with timing offsets
- **Visual**: `GradientTransition` - smooth gradient morphing
- **Particles**: `Particles`, `Spawner`, `Behavior` - declarative particle systems
- **3D**: `Scene3D`, `Step`, `Element3D` - camera-based 3D presentations

## Discovering Bits

Bits are complete composition examples that demonstrate component usage. The registry includes bits alongside components and utilities.

To discover available bits:
```bash
# List all bits
jq 'if type == "object" then .items else . end | .[] | select(.type == "bit") | {name, title, description}' registry.json

# Get full details for a specific bit
jq 'if type == "object" then .items else . end | .[] | select(.name == "bit-3d-basic")' registry.json

# Filter by registry dependencies (e.g., bits using scene-3d)
jq 'if type == "object" then .items else . end | .[] | select(.type == "bit" and (.registryDependencies | contains(["scene-3d"])))' registry.json
```

After discovering a bit in the registry, read its source file to understand implementation details.

## Using Bits and Components

### Installing from Registry

```bash
# Install a bit (copies source to src/compositions/)
npx jsrepo add bit-3d-basic

# Install a component (copies source to src/components/)
npx jsrepo add animated-text

# Dependencies are auto-installed via registryDependencies
```

### Customizing Installed Bits

Bits are **starting points**, not rigid templates:
1. Read the bit source in `src/compositions/` after installing
2. Modify timing, styling, content, and animations as needed
3. The source is yours to customize freely

### Assembling Compositions

Use Remotion's `<Sequence>` to combine bits and custom scenes:

```tsx
import { AbsoluteFill, Sequence } from "remotion";
import { Bit3DBasic } from "./compositions/3DBasic";
import { CustomScene } from "./CustomScene";

export const FinalVideo = () => (
  <AbsoluteFill>
    <Sequence from={0} durationInFrames={150}>
      <Bit3DBasic />
    </Sequence>
    <Sequence from={150} durationInFrames={180}>
      <CustomScene />
    </Sequence>
  </AbsoluteFill>
);
```

### Building Custom Compositions

When bits don't fit, build with components directly:

```tsx
import { AnimatedText, useViewportRect } from "remotion-bits";

export const CustomTitle = () => {
  const rect = useViewportRect();

  return (
    <AnimatedText
      transition={{
        split: "character",
        splitStagger: 2,
        opacity: [0, 1],
        y: [rect.vmin * 10, 0],
        duration: 30,
        easing: "easeOutCubic"
      }}
      style={{ fontSize: rect.vmin * 8 }}
    >
      Your Title
    </AnimatedText>
  );
};
```

## Finding Examples

- **Installed bits**: `src/compositions/` - Full working compositions
- **Bit source files**: Query registry for `files[].relativePath` to locate originals
- **Reference patterns**: [references/patterns.md](references/patterns.md) - Common recipes
- **Component APIs**: [references/components.md](references/components.md) - Props and usage

and Using Bits

### Finding Bits

Bits are discoverable via the jsrepo registry. Use `jq` to query `registry.json`:

```bash
# List all available bits
jq 'if type == "object" then .items else . end | .[] | select(.type == "bit") | {name, title, description}' registry.json

# Find bits using specific components (e.g., Scene3D)
jq 'if type == "object" then .items else . end | .[] | select(.type == "bit" and (.registryDependencies | contains(["scene-3d"])))' registry.json

# Get installation details for a specific bit
jq 'if type == "object" then .items else . end | .[] | select(.name == "bit-3d-basic")' registry.json
```

After finding a bit in the registry, **read its source file** to understand the implementation before installing.

### Installing Bits

```bash
# Install a bit (copies source to src/compositions/)
npx jsrepo add bit-3d-basic

# Dependencies are auto-installed (e.g., scene-3d component)
```

### Customizing Bits

Bits are **starting points for customization**, not rigid templates:

1. Read the bit source file to understand its structure
2. Install the bit via jsrepo (copies source code to your project)
3. Modify the composition in `src/compositions/` to fit your needs
4. Adjust timing, styling, content, animations as needed

### Common Bit Patterns

When reviewing bit source files, look for:
- **`metadata.registry.registryDependencies`**: Which components the bit uses
- **`useViewportRect()`**: How it handles responsive sizing
- **Timing**: `duration`, `transitionDuration`, stagger values
- **Animation patterns**: How `AnimatedValue` arrays create motion
- **Component composition**: How multiple components work together

## Assembling Remotion Videos

### Sequencing with Remotion

Use `<Sequence>` to combine bits and custom scenes:

```tsx
import { AbsoluteFill, Sequence } from "remotion";
import { Bit3DBasic } from "./compositions/3DBasic";
import { BitParticlesSnow } from "./compositions/ParticlesSnow";

export const FinalVideo = () => (
  <AbsoluteFill>
    <Sequence from={0} durationInFrames={150}>
      <Bit3DBasic />
    </Sequence>
    <Sequence from={150} durationInFrames={180}>
      <BitParticlesSnow />
    </Sequence>
  </AbsoluteFill>
);
```

### Building Custom Compositions

When bits don't fit your needs, build custom compositions with components:

```tsx
import { AnimatedText, useViewportRect } from "remotion-bits";
import { useCurrentFrame } from "remotion";

export const CustomTitle = () => {
  const rect = useViewportRect();

  return (
    <AnimatedText
      transition={{
        split: "character",
        splitStagger: 2,
        opacity: [0, 1],
        y: [rect.vmin * 10, 0],
        duration: 30,
        easing: "easeOutCubic"
      }}
      style={{ fontSize: rect.vmin * 8 }}
    >
      Your Title Here
    </AnimatedText>
  );
};
```
